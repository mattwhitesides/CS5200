  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles}.
    
    Please refer to the following labled nodes version of the graph for some of the questions.\\
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{1_Graph.png}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A Hamiltonian Path is defined as, "a graph path between two vertices of a graph that visits each vertex exactly once". Which yes this graph does have at least one. 
        
        For example the path in the labeled version above: 
        
        ${A \rightarrow F \rightarrow H \rightarrow I \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow G \rightarrow J \rightarrow K \rightarrow D \rightarrow L}$ 
        
        would be a Hamiltonian Path.

        \item A Hamiltonian Cycle is defined as, " is a graph cycle (i.e., closed loop) through a graph that visits each node exactly once.".
        
        Given a node has to be used once, each node that has a degree of 2 would have to have both of it's edges used therefore edges (A,F),(F, H) and (J, G)(G, C) must be part of our cycle if one exists. 
        
        However if we must include these four edges note that no matter which direction we attemt to get to verticies (A, H) and (J, G) we form a closed subcircuit. 
        See the graph below to demonstrate this note the blue are edges we know must be in there and red and orage are two possible paths to those edges and both form a closed loop without including all the other verticies.

        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{1_Graph2.jpg}

        Therefore we know that this graph has no Hamiltonian cycle.

        \item
        \begin{itemize}          
          \item \textbf{The Problem.}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item We want to prove an n-dimensional cube contains a Hamiltonian Cycle. 
            \item An n-dimensional cube is defned as follows. It consists of the 2n vertices of the form $(a_0, a_1, ..., a_n)$ where each $a_i$ is either 0 or 1.
            \item Hamiltonian Cycle is defined as, " is a graph cycle (i.e., closed loop) through a graph that visits each node exactly once.".
            \item Our domain of n is any positive natual number in $n \ge 2$. As 0 would mean no edges or verticies and would be nothing, 1 would just be a line of two verticies which would not contain any cycles therefore not Hamiltonian, and a negitive numbers of edges does not make sense.
          \end{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Check the base case plus one.}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Base case: $n = 2$: This is true as this is just a square with 4 verticies and 4 edges, and if you simply use every edge you have formed a Hamiltonian cycle.
            
            I.e. if you go though $(0,0) \rightarrow (0,1) \rightarrow (1,1) \rightarrow (1,0) \rightarrow returns\;to\;(0,0)$.
            \item $n = 3$: This would form a cube which we could represnt with the following graph (if you convert the letters to A = (0,0,0), B = (0,0,1).. etc:             
            
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{cube.png}

            Which we can see has a Hamiltonian cycle if you follow the path:
            
            ${(A \rightarrow E \rightarrow F \rightarrow G \rightarrow H \rightarrow D \rightarrow C \rightarrow B \rightarrow returns\;to\;A)}$.
          \end{itemize}
          \item \textbf{The Inductive Hypothesis.}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Lets assume using the induction Hypothesis that an (n - 1) dimensional cube does in fact contain a Hamiltonian Cycle.
            \item We can agree that cube n is essentailly cube (n - 1) with all adjecent edges connected to another (n - 1) cube.
            \item Lets define our n-dimensional cube as $C^n$.
            \item Therefore say for each vertex $v \in C^{n - 1}$ there is an adjecent vertex $v \in C'^{n - 1}$ that forms $C^n$.
            \item We can show this by our base cases of $n = 2$ is $(00, 01, 10, 11)$ then $n = 3$ is $(000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111)$ .
            \item So we know that an n-cube contains $2^{nâˆ’1}n$ edges and $2^(n - 1) * 2$ verticies therefore we have an extra $2^{(-1 + n)} (-2 + n)$ edges connecting two adject $(n - 1)$ cubes. 
            \item We can also represent cube $n - 1$ within cube $n$ but adding a 0 in front of cube n's verticies (i.e. n = 2 is contained in (000, 001, 010, 011)) which we can call $v \in (0,1)^{n-1}$.
            \item And we can form a path from every edge $0_{v \in cube(n - 1)}$ like shown in the example above, except for the edge that goes though $0_n$ (or all zeros). This leaves an edge to connect to vertex $1_{v \in cube(n - 1)}$, then a path back to $0_n$.
            \item I.e. in the simple case n = 1 to n = 2. We have $v \in (0, 1)^1$ takes $0_{v \in cube(2 - 1)}$ or $00, 01$ connects those, then connects to $1_{v \in cube(2 - 1)}$ is $10, 11$ and finally back to $00$ to form the cycle.
            \item This using the Inductive Hypothesis can be scaled up to any $n \geq 2$. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concluson.}        
        Therefore we have proven using the inductve Hypothesis that any n-dimensional cube where $n \ge 2$ does contain a Hamiltonian Cycle.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{General Graph Theory}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ToDo.
        \item Let's try a bit of a backword induction approach.
        
        If there are $N = 2$ people at the party then each person would have shaken hands with $(N - 1)$ person, e.g. the person other than John shook hands with one person which must be John.

        So if $Q(n)$ is out problem given $n$ people how many hands did John shake then $Q(2) = 1$.

        Now if $N = 3$ than we have John and two others which at most could have shaken hands with $(N - 1)$ person so the other handshakes would be $(N - 1), (N - 2)$ or $(2),(1)$.
